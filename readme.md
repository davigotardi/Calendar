Calendar
This is a simple JavaScript code that creates a calendar. The calendar shows the current month and year, and it also shows the dates of the previous and next months.

Once you have the code, you can modify it to change the appearance of the calendar. For example, you can change the colors of the calendar, or you can add more features, such as the ability to add events to the calendar.
